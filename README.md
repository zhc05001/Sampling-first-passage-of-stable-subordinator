# Exact sampling of the first passage of a stable subordinator
This R package is for exact sampling of the first passage event of a stable subordinator across a boundary.  The algorithms implemented in the package are developed in 

Chi, Z. (2024). *Complexity of exact sampling of the first passage of a stable subordinator*. [arXiv:xxxxx](http://merlot.stat.uconn.edu/~zhc05001/)

- Note that the currently the package only samples the first passage event across a **constant** function.  However, the first passage event across a non-constant regular boundary can be easily sampled using the package; see Algorithm 2.1 in Chi (2024).
